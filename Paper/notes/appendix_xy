Here we investigate this issue by calculating the spectral properties of a single hole introduced to the otherwise undoped (half-filled) ground state of the isotropic $XY$ model. The spectral function $A(k,\omega)$ of a single hole is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:xy_spectral_function}. The eigen states of the model are symmetric with respect not only $k=0$ but also $k=\frac{\pi}{2}$. While this cannot be seen in the spectral function of the single hole in the $t$--$J$ model, there is small but non-zero weight visible in the $t$-$XY$ limit outside of the compact support known from the spin-charge separation ansatz. 

The above-mentioned result on its own does not yet give a conclusive answer for the character of the ground state. Thus we calculate the gap from the ground state to the finst excited state $\Delta E$ at $k = \frac{\pi}{2}$ for system sizes $L = 12, 16, 20, 24$ sites. as well as the corresponding residues $z$. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:xy_finite_size_scaling}. Following the same ansatz as for the finite size scaling as in the main thext we observe that most likely $\Delta E$ as well as $z$ they both approach zero in the thermodynamic limit. Therefore, contrary to what one could expect in the first case, we excpect lack of the spin-polaron quasiparticle in the isotropic $XY$ limit.

To unambigously verify the above claim, we calculate the spin-hole-spin correlation function $C(s,d)$. The extensive region of ferromagnetic spin-spin correlations (see blue region in Fig.~\ref{fig...}) appears due to the motion of the hole. Since it extends to the boundary of the system, where correlations eventually disappear, the conclusion is clear. The ground state of a single hole in the $t$-$XY$ cannot be described as a spin polaron of a finite size (in thermodynamic limit), but instead it should be rather understood in terms of the spin-charge separation. 

So why lack of the magnon-magnon interactions does not lead to the spin-polaron ground state in the isotropic $t$--$XY$ model in 1D? The important thing is to look at the interplay of the magnon-magnon interactions and magnon on-site energy. In the $t$--$J$ model taking any $\lambda \neq 1$ (i.e. scaling the magnon-magnon interaction away from its original value) breaks the neat balance that allows for the consecutive magnons to be created without energetic cost. Eventually each magnon effectively costs energy when $\lambda \neq 1$. This does not apply to the $XY$ limit, where by definition all the mangons do not cost energy, and such balance cannot be broken due to the lack of $S_i^z S_j^z$ spin interactions which determine both on-site energy and strength of the magnon-magnon interactions. Therefore, the $XY$ limit resambles to some degree the physics of the $t$--$J$ model with $\labda = 1$ but not $\lambda \neq 1$.
